# Anaconda---Snake-Game
Anaconda is a fully fledged non graphic snake game created completely using C++, with concepts of keeping a track of top scores using fill handling. It is an attempt to relive the childhood memories in a joyous way :)

Feel free to tinker with the source code and add your own features to the game, or if you are here just for some fun, Download the .exe file and try beating my score :D
